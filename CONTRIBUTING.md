## üé® Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some exceptions:

- **Line length**: Maximum 120 characters
- **Imports**: Group imports in this order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Related third-party imports
  3. Local application imports
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Add docstrings** to all functions, classes, and modules

**Example:**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings

from rest_framework import serializers

from .models import Product


def calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):
    """
    Calculate the discounted price.
    
    Args:
        price (Decimal): Original price
        discount_percentage (int): Discount percentage (0-100)
    
    Returns:
        Decimal: Discounted price
    """
    return price * (1 - discount_percentage / 100)
```

### Django Best Practices

- Use Django's built-in features when possible
- Follow the "fat models, thin views" principle
- Use Django's class-based views appropriately
- Properly handle exceptions
- Use Django's translation framework for user-facing strings
- Write database-agnostic code

### API Design Guidelines

- Use RESTful conventions
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Return appropriate status codes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use pagination for list endpoints
- Version your API when making breaking changes
